# *Problem 1.* Midwestern University has 1/3 of its students taking 9 credit hours, 1/3 taking 12 credit hours, and 1/3 taking 15 credit hours. If X represents the credit hours a student is taking, the distribution of X is p(x) = 1/3 for x = 9, 12, and 15.

# *Problem 2.1* A population consists of the four numbers 3, 7, 11, and 15. Consider all possible samples of size 2 that can be drawn with replacement from this population.
